Solution->Algorithms->Cube-Face-Rotations->Macro-Move-Blocks->Basic moves.

Solution:
Solving the whole cube.

Algorithm:
Getting a particular task done, on the cube.

Cube-Face-Rotations:
Rotate a specific face on the cube, and return to original position.
Sean wants us to optimize several of these together. 
Rather, his idea for the optimizer is between algorithms and CFRs.

Macro-Move-Blocks:
A CFR is made of 3 Macro-Move-Blocks: <Roll desired face into bottom> <Rotate bottom as needed> <Rotate back into original position>
Each defines an action done via a series of motor actions. 
My optimizer compresses Macro-Move-Blocks into smaller ones.
A good optimizer would take the last MMB of a CFR and the first MMB of the next CFR and concatenate them before compressing.

Basic moves:
Actions that the motor does.
r: Rotate base CW.
l: Rotate base CCW.
g: Grab the cube and lock it in place.
f: Flip the cube forwards.






LB:
<Roll left into position> <Rotate bottom> <Roll into original position> <Roll back into position> <Rotate bottom> <Roll into original position>
